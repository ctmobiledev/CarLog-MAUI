# CarLog-MAUI

CarLog is a basic CRUD app that allows the user to maintain maintenance records on one or more motor vehicles. It can also be used to document other, less pleasant events (flats, fender-benders, breakdowns). But the key idea is simple: enter a vehicle’s basic information, then – as needed – enter events with a one-to-many data relationship.
